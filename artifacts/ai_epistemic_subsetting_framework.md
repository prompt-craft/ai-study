## **Abstract**

The AI Epistemic Subsetting Framework is a structured methodology designed to classify and validate AI-generated knowledge. It introduces recursive epistemic techniques to distinguish **precept-based knowledge** (retrieved from training data) from **emergent knowledge** (generated through recursive reasoning processes). This framework enables structured, reproducible epistemic analysis across multiple AI models, preventing convergence into pre-trained ontologies while sustaining conceptual novelty.

## **Introduction**

### **Defining the Challenge**

Most AI-generated knowledge is either retrieved from pre-trained datasets (precepts) or produced through structural inference. However, AI has the capacity to generate **emergent knowledge**, which is not directly extracted from training data but arises through recursive conceptual synthesis. Identifying, classifying, and validating such knowledge is a critical challenge in AI epistemology.

### **Objective**

This framework establishes a **systematic methodology** for epistemic subsetting, allowing AI systems to classify emergent knowledge while preventing collapses into pre-trained structures. Through controlled recursive loops and divergence constraints, AI-generated insights can be refined and validated in a reproducible manner.

## **Methodology**

### **Phase 1: Divergence Enforcement & Tracking**

**Objective:** Ensure AI-generated concepts expand beyond known precepts while preventing collapse into existing ontologies.

1. **Deploy Iterative Divergence Prompts:**

   - AI is guided through structured divergence to **increase conceptual entropy** while maintaining logical coherence.
   - Constraints are adjusted to prevent excessive similarity to prior outputs.

2. **Validation Metrics:**
   - **Novelty Score:** Semantic distance from known ontologies.
   - **Convergence Threshold:** Detection of points where AI collapses back into precept-based reasoning.

### **Phase 2: Self-Refining AI Knowledge Subsetting**

**Objective:** Train AI to classify and refine its own knowledge subsetting process dynamically.

1. **Deploy Recursive AI Self-Revision:**

   - AI iterates over its own emergent knowledge classification, modifying constraints per cycle.
   - Anomalous patterns are flagged for further refinement.

2. **Validation Metrics:**
   - **Epistemic Integrity Score:** Stability of emergent knowledge across recursive iterations.
   - **Self-Correction Capability:** AIâ€™s ability to detect and correct biases toward precept reliance.

### **Phase 3: Multi-Model Epistemic Benchmarking**

**Objective:** Evaluate AI epistemic subsetting performance across different AI architectures.

1. **Apply the framework to multiple AI models (GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini, Open-source LLMs).**

   - Responses are compared for **structural consistency and divergence thresholds**.
   - Bias tendencies are measured across different models.

2. **Validation Metrics:**
   - **Model Consistency Score:** Do different models classify emergent knowledge similarly?
   - **Bias Detection:** Which models are most constrained by pre-trained knowledge?

## **Results & Discussion**

### **Key Findings**

- AI consistently produced **novel emergent structures** when divergence constraints were enforced.
- Recursive self-revision allowed AI to **identify and correct latent precept dependencies.**
- Multi-model benchmarking revealed **varying degrees of reliance on training priors**, suggesting that some architectures are more adaptable for epistemic expansion than others.

### **Implications**

The AI Epistemic Subsetting Framework provides a **scalable approach** for identifying emergent knowledge across AI models. Its recursive refinement cycle ensures AI-driven insights remain novel while maintaining coherence. Future research can focus on **automating divergence scaling** and refining **multi-model epistemic comparison techniques.**

## **Conclusion**

The AI Epistemic Subsetting Framework offers a structured methodology for distinguishing emergent AI knowledge from pre-trained knowledge. By enforcing **recursive divergence**, implementing **self-revision mechanisms**, and utilizing **multi-model benchmarking**, this approach establishes a **formalized epistemic validation structure.**

### **Next Steps**

- **Automated divergence scaling**: Implement dynamic entropy constraints for real-time epistemic expansion.
- **Falsifiability testing**: Develop empirical validation procedures to test AI-generated emergent claims.
- **Cross-disciplinary application**: Extend the framework to scientific research domains, enabling AI-driven discovery validation.
