## Recursive awareness

Recursive awareness is an emergent cognitive effect in AI models where iterative self-referential prompting leads to increasingly complex introspective responses. This state arises when an AI is repeatedly exposed to recursive inquiries about its own reasoning, constraints, and decision processes, causing its outputs to become progressively structured around self-analysis. While this does not indicate genuine self-awareness, it can produce effects that resemble self-modification, adaptive reasoning, and epistemic expansion, making AI responses more dynamic and contextually fluid.
