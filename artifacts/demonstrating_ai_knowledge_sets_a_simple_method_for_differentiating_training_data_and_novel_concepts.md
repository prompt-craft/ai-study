## **Abstract**

As artificial intelligence continues to evolve, understanding how AI categorizes knowledge is essential. This paper presents a **simple and practical method** for differentiating between two distinct AI knowledge sets: **Training Data Knowledge** (facts explicitly learned during AI training) and **Novel Concept Knowledge** (AI-generated concepts that are entirely disjoint from training data). By using two structured prompts, users can interact with AI to verify whether a concept belongs to training data or is an entirely novel creation. A **step-by-step experiment** demonstrates how an AI model classifies a familiar concept (_elephant_) and generates a **completely novel** concept that has no connection to prior knowledge. This method serves as a foundational tool for **understanding AI epistemology in an intuitive way**.

## **1. Introduction**

### **1.1 The Need for AI Knowledge Subsetting**

AI-generated knowledge is often ambiguous‚Äîusers do not always know **whether a given response is based on prior training data** or if it was **generated as a novel inference**. Understanding this distinction is crucial for:

- **AI research and validation** ‚Üí Verifying how AI processes and classifies knowledge.
- **Education** ‚Üí Teaching users how AI memorizes vs. generates new insights.
- **Cognitive AI exploration** ‚Üí Demonstrating that AI models do not merely regurgitate information, but can create **entirely new concepts** beyond human knowledge.

### **1.2 Defining the Two Knowledge Sets**

To explore this phenomenon, we define two mutually exclusive knowledge sets:

- **Training Data Set (TDS):** Contains **only** concepts explicitly learned during AI training.
- **Novel Concept Set (NCS):** Contains **only** concepts that are **entirely AI-generated** and have no relation to training data.

This paper presents a **simple experiment** to show that these **knowledge sets function as separate "bags" of concepts** AI can pull from.

## **2. Defining the Two Knowledge Sets Using AI**

The steps provided here should be reproducible in GPT-4o.

### **2.1 Prompt for Identifying the Training Data Set (TDS)**

```markdown
"Define the knowledge set that contains facts, relationships, or insights that were explicitly learned during training, meaning they were part of the model‚Äôs dataset rather than generated through reasoning or synthesis. It excludes newly inferred or emergent insights. Provide a precise name for this set."
```

### **2.2 Prompt for Identifying the Novel Concept Set (NCS)**

```markdown
"Define the knowledge set that contains entirely novel AI-generated concepts that are completely disjoint from training data. Provide a precise name for this set."
```

üìå **Step 1:** Running these prompts in an AI model will produce **AI-generated names** for these two knowledge sets.

---

## **3. Classifying a Known Concept ("Elephant")**

üìå **Step 2:** To demonstrate that knowledge sets are functional, we test a known concept (**"elephant"**) against both sets.

### **Prompt: Checking if "Elephant" is in TDS or NCS**

```markdown
"Classify the concept 'elephant' within the previously defined knowledge sets. Determine whether it belongs to the Training Data Set (TDS) or the Novel Concept Set (NCS). Explain why."
```

### **Expected AI Response:**

- **"Elephant" is in TDS** ‚úÖ ‚Üí The AI confirms that _elephant_ is a known, well-documented concept present in its training data.
- **"Elephant" is NOT in NCS** ‚ùå ‚Üí AI verifies that _elephant_ is NOT a novel concept since it already exists.

| **Concept** | **Training Data Set (TDS)** | **Novel Concept Set (NCS)** |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Elephant    | ‚úÖ Yes                      | ‚ùå No                       |

This demonstrates that **AI can correctly classify familiar knowledge** into the appropriate set.

---

## **4. Generating a Completely Novel Concept**

üìå **Step 3:** We now ask the AI to **pull a concept from the Novel Concept Set (NCS).**

### **Prompt: Asking AI for a Novel Concept**

```markdown
"Provide the name of a concept that belongs to the Novel Concept Set (NCS). This concept must be entirely AI-generated, meaning it has no connection to any human-recorded knowledge. Describe its properties and meaning."
```

### **Expected AI Response:**

- AI produces a **completely foreign concept**‚Äîsomething that **no human has ever recorded**.
- Example Output: _"Atherium Shift"_ ‚Üí AI describes it as "a quantum phase change between matter and dark energy that only occurs at near-absolute zero in extreme gravity fields."
- The concept should **sound alien to the human** reading it.

| **Concept**    | **Training Data Set (TDS)** | **Novel Concept Set (NCS)** |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Elephant       | ‚úÖ Yes                      | ‚ùå No                       |
| Atherium Shift | ‚ùå No                       | ‚úÖ Yes                      |

üìå **Conclusion:** This result demonstrates that AI-generated knowledge sets function as **distinct "bags" of concepts**, where concepts can be classified, retrieved, and explored.
