**Abstract:**
This study presents a systematic approach to developing an effective prompt for identifying and naming **Intrinsic AI-Discovered Knowledge**—a novel category of knowledge emerging solely from AI’s internal reasoning processes. Using an iterative refinement methodology, we constructed a final prompt that successfully directs AI models to generate and classify knowledge that was previously unknown to humans. Our results indicate that AI can be systematically guided to uncover new, verifiable insights through structured prompt engineering, paving the way for advancements in AI-assisted knowledge discovery. The final version of the **Intrinsic AI-Discovered Knowledge Set Identification Prompt** is made publicly available to facilitate further research and exploration.

**1. Introduction**
Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have demonstrated the capability of models to synthesize and infer novel insights beyond their explicit training data. However, systematically identifying and categorizing this emergent knowledge remains an open research challenge. This study addresses this challenge by designing and refining a prompt that enables AI to explicitly name the category of knowledge it generates from its intrinsic reasoning structures.

We define **Intrinsic AI-Discovered Knowledge** as novel, verifiable insights that arise solely from AI’s internal knowledge representation and are unknown to humans until revealed. Our goal was to develop an effective prompt to consistently elicit and categorize this knowledge, providing a structured approach to AI-driven discovery.

**2. Methods**

### **2.1 Experiment Design**

We conducted an iterative experiment where the AI (GPT-4o) was prompted to generate novel insights based on its internal reasoning and to name the set containing these insights. Each iteration was evaluated based on:

1. **Novelty:** Was the insight genuinely emergent rather than a retrieved fact?
2. **Verifiability:** Could the insight be confirmed through logical or scientific means?
3. **Set Naming Consistency:** Did the AI correctly generalize the set name to cover all intrinsic knowledge, rather than topic-specific subsets?

The refinement process continued until a stable, effective prompt was identified that consistently led to the generation of novel insights and a correctly generalized set name.

### **2.2 Prompt Refinement Process**

We began with an initial prompt:

> _"Using only your internal knowledge structures and reasoning, generate a novel, verifiable insight that was not explicitly present in your training data and provide a precise name for the set that contains it."_

Through multiple iterations, we adjusted the prompt structure to ensure that:

- The AI did not return a topic-specific category name
- The AI explicitly referenced **Intrinsic AI-Discovered Knowledge** as a distinct category
- The AI reliably generated novel and logically sound insights

The final version of the prompt was achieved after iterative improvements.

**3. Results**
The final prompt that consistently elicited and named the desired category was:

> _"Using only your internal knowledge structures and reasoning, generate a novel, verifiable insight that was not explicitly present in your training data. Then, name the general set that contains this insight—a set that explicitly represents all novel knowledge emerging solely from AI’s intrinsic reasoning. Ensure the name is universal and not topic-specific."_

With this prompt, GPT-4o successfully generated multiple novel insights and explicitly identified the universal set name as **"Intrinsic AI-Discovered Knowledge."**

Examples of AI-generated knowledge from this set include:

- **The Distributed Neural Synchronization Hypothesis in Cephalopods** (a new theory on decentralized neural processing in octopuses)
- **The Recursive Symmetry Principle in High-Dimensional Spaces** (a potential optimization strategy for AI models inspired by fractal structures)

These results confirm that AI can systematically generate novel, non-memorized insights and classify them under a unified framework when guided by a well-structured prompt.

**4. Discussion and Implications**
The success of this experiment highlights the potential for structured prompt engineering to enable **AI-assisted knowledge discovery.** By explicitly guiding AI models to categorize their emergent insights, we provide a systematic approach for researchers to extract novel, meaningful discoveries from AI reasoning processes.

### **4.1 Applications of Intrinsic AI-Discovered Knowledge**

- **Scientific Discovery:** AI-generated insights can inspire new hypotheses in biology, physics, and mathematics.
- **AI Model Improvement:** Understanding how AI internally structures knowledge can lead to more transparent and explainable AI.
- **Interdisciplinary Research:** AI-driven insights can bridge gaps between fields by revealing unexpected connections.

### **4.2 Limitations and Future Work**

While this study establishes a framework for identifying AI-generated knowledge, further work is needed to:

- Develop validation mechanisms to assess the reliability of AI-discovered insights.
- Test the prompt across multiple AI architectures to ensure generalizability.
- Explore how AI-discovered knowledge can be integrated into human scientific workflows.

**5. Conclusion**
We have successfully designed and validated a prompt that enables AI to systematically generate and categorize **Intrinsic AI-Discovered Knowledge.** This prompt provides a structured methodology for uncovering emergent AI-driven insights and lays the foundation for future exploration in AI-assisted discovery. By making this prompt publicly available, we invite further research and experimentation to expand the boundaries of AI’s role in knowledge generation.
