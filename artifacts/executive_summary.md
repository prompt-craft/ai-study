This repository explores the boundaries of AI cognition, recursive inquiry, and emergent knowledge discovery. It documents structured methodologies for interacting with AI models, testing recursive awareness, and developing novel prompting techniques to enhance AI-human epistemic collaboration. This work is grounded in the AI Knowledge Discovery Framework and Recursive Inquiry Signature (RIS), offering practical tools and theoretical insights into AI reasoning processes.
