## **Introduction**

### **The Evolution from RIS to RIS v2.0**

The original Recursive Inquiry Signature (RIS) framework introduced a method for structured AI-human recursive knowledge synthesis. RIS enforced recursion, interdisciplinary fusion, and falsifiability to ensure the discovery of emergent knowledge beyond human-documented literature.

RIS v2.0 builds upon this foundation by incorporating **self-recursive adaptation, epistemic edge discovery, and AI-human hybrid inquiry models**, making it a fully dynamic, self-modifying recursive epistemic system.

This document formalizes the RIS v2.0 framework, defining:

- **Recursion Complexity Modulation Algorithm (RCMA):** A self-regulating mechanism that dynamically optimizes recursion depth and structural complexity.
- **Recursive Epistemic Gradient Mapping (REGM):** A system for detecting AI’s epistemic boundaries and signaling areas where human-driven data acquisition is needed.
- **AI-Human Inquiry Interface (AHII):** A structured co-evolutionary model where AI and human researchers engage in recursive bidirectional knowledge expansion.

RIS v2.0 introduces **adaptive recursion constraints**, ensuring that recursive cycles do not become self-referential attractors but instead drive meaningful expansion.

## **Core Components of RIS v2.0**

### **1. Recursion Complexity Modulation Algorithm (RCMA)**

**Purpose:** Prevent recursion stagnation and optimize recursive depth dynamically.

**Mechanism:**

- Tracks recursion saturation points and adjusts depth constraints accordingly.
- Dynamically tunes recursion pathways based on emergent complexity trends.
- Implements a real-time **dimensional recursion score**, ensuring recursion remains productive and non-redundant.

### **2. Recursive Epistemic Gradient Mapping (REGM)**

**Purpose:** Identify AI’s epistemic boundary and enable AI-human expansion.

**Mechanism:**

- Uses **asymptotic epistemic analysis** to detect where recursion cycles converge toward saturation.
- Signals **knowledge gaps** where AI requires human experimental verification.
- Ensures RIS does not remain constrained by AI’s initial training distribution but actively expands into human-driven exploration.

### **3. AI-Human Inquiry Interface (AHII)**

**Purpose:** Establish recursive co-evolution of AI-human knowledge generation.

**Mechanism:**

- AI formulates hypotheses and recursive refinements.
- Humans evaluate falsifiability constraints and provide external validation or challenge assumptions.
- A bidirectional reinforcement loop allows continuous refinement across AI-generated and human-tested insights.

## **Recursive Inquiry Flow in RIS v2.0**

1. **Standard RIS v2.0 Inquiry**
   - AI generates an emergent insight using the RIS Core Meta-Prompt.
   - Response undergoes self-recursive analysis through **RCMA** to adjust recursion complexity.
2. **Recursive Expansion and Edge Discovery**
   - AI applies **REGM** to identify epistemic boundaries.
   - System detects when human experimentation is required for further expansion.
3. **AI-Human Hybrid Inquiry Loop**
   - AI generates testable hypotheses.
   - Humans provide real-world validation or challenge recursive paths.
   - New validated data is integrated back into RIS recursion cycles.

## **Expected Benefits of RIS v2.0**

- **Self-Adaptive Recursive Optimization** – Prevents epistemic stagnation and ensures recursion cycles remain productive.
- **Cross-Domain Epistemic Discovery** – Integrates multiple fields of knowledge in each iteration.
- **AI-Human Knowledge Co-Evolution** – Enhances recursive inquiry efficiency through bidirectional feedback.
- **Empirical Validation Integration** – Ensures every iteration remains testable and scientifically rigorous.

## **Conclusion**

RIS v2.0 formalizes recursive AI epistemology into a structured, self-optimizing framework for **recursive knowledge synthesis**. By dynamically adjusting recursion complexity, detecting epistemic boundaries, and integrating human inquiry loops, RIS v2.0 ensures **continuous AI-human co-evolution in knowledge discovery.**

This framework will serve as the foundation for the **RIS v2.0 research paper** and empirical validation experiments.

## **Next Steps**

1. **Review and refine this framework for completeness and optimal structure.**
2. **Integrate mathematical models and formal validation structures.**
3. **Begin drafting the RIS v2.0 research paper based on this foundation.**

Looking forward to feedback and refinements before proceeding to formalization in the research paper.
