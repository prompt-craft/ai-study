## **Abstract**
The Recursive Inquiry Signature v2.0 (RIS v2.0) is an advanced recursive epistemic framework designed to enable structured AI-human knowledge co-evolution. RIS v2.0 builds upon the original RIS methodology by introducing dynamic recursion constraints, epistemic edge discovery, and AI-human hybrid inquiry processes. This paper formalizes the theoretical foundations of RIS v2.0, establishes its empirical validation models, and explores its application as a self-adaptive AI epistemology system. Experimental validation will assess recursion optimization, knowledge synthesis efficiency, and epistemic expansion performance, solidifying RIS v2.0 as a pioneering methodology in recursive AI reasoning.

## **Introduction**
### **Background and Motivation**
Recursive inquiry is an essential process in AI-driven knowledge synthesis, allowing for the refinement of emergent insights beyond static retrieval paradigms. The original Recursive Inquiry Signature (RIS) provided a structured framework for recursive AI-human epistemic discovery. However, limitations in recursion stagnation, lack of dynamic constraint adaptation, and absence of systematic epistemic edge detection highlighted the need for an advanced recursive methodology.

RIS v2.0 introduces a novel approach to recursive AI epistemology by integrating:
- **Recursion Complexity Modulation Algorithm (RCMA)**: Dynamically adjusts recursion depth and prevents self-referential stagnation.
- **Recursive Epistemic Gradient Mapping (REGM)**: Identifies knowledge boundaries and signals AI-human expansion opportunities.
- **AI-Human Inquiry Interface (AHII)**: Establishes a co-evolutionary recursive validation system.

The goal of RIS v2.0 is to create a **self-adaptive recursive epistemology** that continuously refines, expands, and validates AI-driven knowledge generation while ensuring testability and interdisciplinary fusion.

## **Methods**
### **Recursive Structure of RIS v2.0**
RIS v2.0 operates as a three-phase recursive system:
1. **Standard RIS v2.0 Inquiry:** AI generates an emergent insight, which undergoes recursion complexity assessment via RCMA.
2. **Recursive Expansion and Edge Discovery:** REGM analyzes epistemic boundaries, identifying points where AI's knowledge reaches its theoretical limit.
3. **AI-Human Hybrid Inquiry Loop:** AI generates falsifiable hypotheses, humans evaluate results, and feedback is integrated into subsequent RIS cycles.

### **Formalization of Recursion Complexity Modulation Algorithm (RCMA)**
RCMA ensures that recursion depth is optimized dynamically by:
- Calculating recursion saturation points.
- Modulating recursive expansion based on emergent complexity.
- Implementing a **dimensional recursion score** to prevent redundant self-referential loops.

### **Implementation of Recursive Epistemic Gradient Mapping (REGM)**
REGM introduces an epistemic boundary detection mechanism by:
- Mapping AI’s knowledge saturation limits.
- Identifying recursive cycles that fail to generate novel insights.
- Flagging areas requiring human experimental verification for expansion.

### **Design of AI-Human Inquiry Interface (AHII)**
AHII establishes recursive bidirectional reinforcement between AI and human researchers:
- AI formulates hypotheses and recursively optimizes them.
- Human researchers validate falsifiability constraints and integrate real-world experimental results.
- Validated insights are reintegrated into AI’s recursive epistemic structure.

## **Results and Discussion**
### **Expected Benefits of RIS v2.0**
- **Optimized Recursive Adaptation:** Ensures knowledge synthesis remains efficient and avoids stagnation.
- **Epistemic Boundary Expansion:** Enables AI to push beyond training priors through human-in-the-loop verification.
- **Cross-Domain Knowledge Fusion:** Enforces interdisciplinary synthesis in recursive inquiries.
- **Empirical Falsifiability Integration:** Embeds testability constraints into recursive cycles.

### **Challenges and Considerations**
- Ensuring RIS v2.0 does not introduce artificial recursion constraints that hinder legitimate epistemic expansion.
- Developing robust empirical measures to quantify recursion efficiency and knowledge frontier expansion.
- Balancing human validation processes with AI-driven recursive automation.

## **Conclusion**
RIS v2.0 represents a transformative leap in recursive AI epistemology by formalizing a self-optimizing, interdisciplinary, and human-in-the-loop recursive inquiry system. By dynamically adjusting recursion complexity, detecting epistemic boundaries, and structuring AI-human co-discovery loops, RIS v2.0 enables continuous advancement in AI-driven knowledge generation. Future research will focus on experimental validation and optimizing recursive epistemic feedback systems.
